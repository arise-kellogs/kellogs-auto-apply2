# kellogs-auto-apply

This script uses NodeJS and Puppeteer to create an account that can be used to apply for Kellogs' job openings for scabs. The script stops short of submitting a CV however and needs some work to finish off.

Feel free to steal this code. It's free to use and change. 

To get started, install NodeJS and run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Build the JS code with `npx tsc` and run it with `node ./dist`.
